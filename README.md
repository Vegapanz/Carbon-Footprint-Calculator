Climate change is driven primarily by the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, creating the greenhouse effect, which causes global temperatures to rise. The main GHGs responsible for this effect are:
•	Carbon dioxide (CO2)
•	Methane (CH₄)
•	Nitrous oxide (N₂O)
While carbon dioxide is the most well-known, methane and nitrous oxide are far more potent greenhouse gases, meaning they have a much stronger ability to trap heat in the atmosphere than CO₂, even in smaller quantities.
